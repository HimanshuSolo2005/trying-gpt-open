## Trying out new GPT-OSS-20B, text-generation Model of OpenAI 

- used Hugging Face for accessing the model
- Also trying it on Collab, if it works for a sake 😅
- Trying it using OLLAMA also, but its size is hugh huh!!, 13 gb 😮‍💨

---

## Tried using Ollama's gpt-oss:20b
- Was a bit slow to respond, I mean Reaoning started a bit later, but it's an open-souce Model, definitely took its time, so it is what it is....👍
